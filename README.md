data.csv contains 234033 MTPL insurance contract details and the claims occured. The file contains all the needed data for the 

# Analysis.ipynb.
The project is performed and coded in Analysis.ipynb python notebook file. It has quite many comments and is easy to understand.
It has 4 main parts that need to be run one by one. (one can use run all command also).
parts: 
1) Data loading and cleansing.
2) Splitting the data into train and test.
3) Regression task performed by RandomTreesRegressor model from sklearn.
4) In the end the Fairness criteria are reported for individual risk.

After running the python notebook the global variable "model" contains the final model's parameters. Also one can easily find the predicted y values in y_pred array.

Thanks!
